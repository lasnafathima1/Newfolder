<p><b>In the after math of child’s disappearance,</b>
<u> Dark follows characters from the fictional German town of Winden as they pursue the truth. </u>
 They follow<mark> connections</mark> between four estranged families to 
 unravel a sinister time travel conspiracy which spans several generations. The series explores the existential implications of time, and its effect on human nature. 
It’s a puzzle box drama wherever each piece has its place, 
wherever all plot purpose fits along. you may draw a graph of this show,
 which may well be the foremost gratifying thanks to consume it — chase 
 the method its time-hopping narrative ultimately comes along to form sense.
<i> Dark</i> reveals its twists with a good sense of virtuosity, 
 to the degree that even those i used to be ready to predict took my breath away, 
 just because of however well the series handled the reveal.<>
